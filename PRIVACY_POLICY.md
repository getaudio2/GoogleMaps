## MapsPhotos - Privacy policy

Welcome to the MapsPhotos app for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by Paul Maigua (getaudio2). The source code is available on GitHub and on Google Play.

I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (e.g.: Location) used by the app is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.
